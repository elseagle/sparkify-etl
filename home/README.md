# Sparkify Data Warehouse ETL

## Project Datasets

Two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

    Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
    Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`


The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

### Log dataset
Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings



### Fact Table 
- `songplays` - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
`songplay_id`, `start_time`, `user_id`, `level`, `song_id`, `artist_id`, `session_id`, `location`, `user_agent`

### Dimension Tables
- `users` - users in the app: `user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender`, `level`
- `songs` - songs in music database : `song_id`, `title`, `artist_id`, `year`, `duration`
- `artists` - artists in music database : `artist_id`, `name`, `location`, `latitude`, `longitude`
- `time` - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units : `start_time`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, 
  `year`, `weekday`


## Setup Application
- To create the tables run: \
``python3 create_tables.py``
- To confirm the tables have been created run the cells in `test.ipynb`
- To perform the etl run: \
  ``python3 etl.py``
- To confirm the etl was successful run the cells in `test.ipynb`

## Files in the repository
- `create_tables` - creates the database and tables needed 
- `etl.py` - processing of the Extraction, Transformation and Loading pipeline
- `sql_queries.py` - The query strings needed by create_tables
